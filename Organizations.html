			<h1>Organizations</h1>
			<h2>Residence Hall Association (RHA) (2023-2025)</h2>
				<p>In this organization, I was a committee member during the school year of 2023-2024 in RHA CORE and I was involved in helping out in events and giving other members event ideas and I also did a little bit of volunteering as well. </p>
				<p>In the school year of 2024-2025, I became the Vice President of my CORE at RHA and I was responsible for setting a budget for my CORE and keeping track of expenses and write meeting minutes. I volunteered at the Haunted Event for 6 hours on Friday. </p>
				<p>I keep track of the budget in a Excel spreadsheet because it is easier to keep track of it there and I can do all the calculations very easily without using a physical calcuator.</p>
				<p>In each CORE meeting, we throw around event ideas and eventually one of those ideas came into reality and some of those events have an educational component such as student mental health and wellness.</p>
				<p>Near the end of the school year, we had a huge event called CORE week where we had to make an event that had an educational component to it and it was a sucesss.</p>
			
			<h2>National Residence Hall Honorary (NRHH) (2024-2025)</h2>
				<p>In this organization, I am a general body member and I do a lot of volunteering in this organization by helping the executive board set up events and give away canned goods to non-profit organizations in Starkville, Mississippi. </p>
				<p>This organization encompasses the value of service, recognition, and leadership. I recently gave away about 3 canned goods to St. Joseph Catholic Church while being apart of this organization.</p>
				<p>I was involved in the voting process to initiate new members into NRHH and volunteered to set up the induction ceremony where new members get inducted into NRHH.</p>
				<p>In this organization, I write OTMs (Of-The-Month) to recognize individuals on campus for improving campus life which includes academic and social aspects of college.</p>
